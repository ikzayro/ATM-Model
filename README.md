# ATM-Model

The bank will have 4 drive-thru servers. These servers will be lined up side by side in 2 pairs. So we will have two queue. When two vehicles come to the left queue at the same time, the one that comes first will be processed on the server that front second car will be processed on the server that rear. Even if the operation of the vehicle in front is finished, the ordinary vehicle on the left will not be able to access the server. Because the vehicle operating on the back server is there and there is no space to pass by. Therefore, the vehicle processing on the back server will be expected to leave.
